# URL Shortener with search based functionality
The user flow in this project involves entering a long URL through a form on the front-end. The back-end receives the long URL, generates a short URL 
using the shortening algorithm, and stores both the long and short URLs in the database. The short URL is then presented to the user, who can share or 
use it to access the original long URL. Additionally, users can search for previously created URLs by entering keywords. The back-end performs a search 
query using MongoDB Atlas Search, retrieves matching results from the database, and presents them to the user.

Overall, the project provides a complete URL shortening solution with the ability to generate short URLs, store them in a database, and offer search 
functionality to retrieve URLs based on keywords.It also has a search based functionalty which has been implemented using MongoDB Atlas search.
